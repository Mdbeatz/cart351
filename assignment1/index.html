        <p>***Hover over the quotes for a surprise***</p><br>

        <p class="changeColor"><a>Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.<br>
        <i><b>Gone with the Wind</b></i><img src="images/frankly.gif"></a> </p>

        <p class="changeColor2"><a>Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.<br>
        <i><b>The Wizard of Oz</b></i><img src="images/toto.gif"></a> </p>

        <p class="changeColor"><a>Don’t ever let somebody tell you you can’t do something, not even me.
          Alright? You dream, you gotta protect it. People can’t do something themselves, they wanna tell you you can’t do it.
          If you want something, go get it. Period.<br>
		        <i><b>The Pursuit of Happyness</b></i><img src="images/happiness.gif"></a></p>

        <p class="changeColor2"><a>Do, or do not. There is no “try”.<br>
		        <i><b>Star Wars: Episode V &ndash; The Empire Strikes Back</b></i><img src="images/yoda.gif"></a></p>

        <p class="changeColor"><a>You see, before he came down here, it never snowed. And afterwards, it did. If he weren't
          up there now... I don't think it would be snowing. Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.<br>
		        <i><b>Edward Scissorhands</b></i><img src="images/edward.gif"></a></p>

        <p class="changeColor2"><a>Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming.<br>
		<i><b>Finding Nemo</b></i><img src="images/dory.gif"></a></p>

        <p class="changeColor"><a>Belief, like fear or love, is a force to be understood as we understand the theory of relativity and principals
          of uncertainty. Phenomena that determine the course of our lives. Yesterday, my life was headed in one direction.
          Today, it is headed in another. Yesterday, I believe I would never have done what I did today. These forces that
          often remake time and space, that can shape and alter who we imagine ourselves to be, begin long before we are born
          and continue after we perish. Our lives and our choices, like quantum trajectories, are understood moment to moment.
          hat each point of intersection, each encounter, suggest a new potential direction. Proposition, I have fallen in love
           with Luisa Rey. Is this possible? I just met her and yet, I feel like something important has happened to me.<br>
		<i><b>Cloud Atlas</b></i><img src="images/cloudatlas.gif"></a></p>

        <p class="changeColor2"><a>Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.<br>
    <i><b>Dead Poets Society</b></i><img src="images/poets.gif"></a></p>

        <p class="changeColor"><a>Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.<br>
		<i><b>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</b></i><img src="images/ferris.gif"></a></p>

        <p class="changeColor2"><a>Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention
          for whatever it was we did wrong. But we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we
          are. You see us as you want to see us - in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found
          out is that each one of us is a brain... and an athlete... and a basket case... a princess... and a criminal...
          Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club.<br>
